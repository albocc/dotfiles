# How to use them
1. Clone the Repository to a location on your system. I have a directory in my
home directory called `Repositories` where I keep all my repositories, including
this one.
2. If you like to use the `.gitignore` templates from github/gitignore, you can
initialize the submodule by running `git submodule update --init`.
These templates are handy when you start your own new project and need a
template for your specific content/language to get started.
3. Run `setup.sh` in your Terminal.
